The rollout of 5G was expected to be a milestone, but how did it actually impact revenue and customer behavior? My latest analysis uncovers some surprising trends:

📉 𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗥𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗻𝘂𝗲 𝗗𝗲𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗲: A slight dip of 𝟬.𝟱𝟬% post-5G launch, with major drops in Delhi (-𝟮.𝟴𝟯%), Chennai (-𝟮.𝟱𝟴%), and Ahmedabad (-𝟮.𝟬𝟮%).

📈 𝗔𝗥𝗣𝗨 (𝗔𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝗥𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗻𝘂𝗲 𝗣𝗲𝗿 𝗨𝘀𝗲𝗿) 𝗜𝗻𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘀𝗲𝗱: Rising from ₹𝟭𝟵𝟬.𝟮 to ₹𝟮𝟭𝟭.𝟯, indicating higher spending by remaining users.

⚠️ 𝗗𝗲𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗲 𝗶𝗻 𝗔𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗨𝘀𝗲𝗿𝘀: A drop from 𝟴𝟰.𝟰𝗠 to 𝟳𝟳.𝟰𝗠, alongside an increase in churn.

𝗣𝗹𝗮𝗻 𝗣𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗣𝗼𝘀𝘁-𝟱𝗚:

✅ 𝗪𝗶𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗿𝘀: Plans P1, P11, and P12 saw strong growth, suggesting users are shifting toward newer 5G-optimized plans.

❌ 𝗟𝗼𝘀𝗲𝗿𝘀: Plans P5, P6, P7, P8, P9, and P10 suffered revenue losses or discontinuation, with P7 alone seeing a 73.3% drop.

💡 𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝗧𝗮𝗸𝗲𝗮𝘄𝗮𝘆: While 5G is driving higher ARPU, the shift in user behavior requires rethinking pricing, bundling, and marketing strategies to retain customers and optimize plan offerings.

A big thank you to @Dhaval Patel and @Hemanand Vadivel for giving me this opportunity to find insights on Wavecon Telecommunication. This project has helped me gain valuable knowledge in this domain.
